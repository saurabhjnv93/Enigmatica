0,Linear Regression, What is Linear Regression Algorithm?,"It is a method of finding the best straight line fitting to the given dataset, i.e. tries to find the best linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables. It is mostly done with the help of the Sum of Squared Residuals Method, known as the Ordinary least squares (OLS) method.",Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used to find the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It aims to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the independent variable(s) by fitting a best-fit straight line.,Linear regression is a statistical method used in machine learning that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. The coefficients of the equation are derived based on minimizing the sum of the squares of the differences between the observed responses and those predicted by the linear model.,"Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the regression function and the independent variable or that a linear model is a reasonable approximation. The model is still linear in the parameters, even with polynomial basis functions or transformations of the inputs. Maximum likelihood estimation and least squares are used to estimate the conditional distribution of the dependent variable given the independent variable. Multiple linear regression extends simple linear regression to multiple independent variables. Linear models have important properties and limitations, are simple and interpretable, and can outperform nonlinear models in situations with small numbers of training data."
1,Linear Regression,How do you interpret a linear regression model?,"The significance of the linear regression model lies in the fact that we can easily interpret and understand the marginal changes in the independent variables(predictors) and observe their consequences on the dependent variable(response). Therefore, a linear regression model is quite easy to interpret.

For Example, if we increase the value of x1 increases by 1 unit, keeping other variables constant, then the total increase in the value of y will be β1 and the intercept term (β0) is the response when all the predictor’s terms are set to zero or not considered",A linear regression model interprets the relationship between the input variables and the target variable by fitting a straight line to the data points that minimizes the prediction error. The model calculates the coefficients for each input variable to quantify their impact on the target variable.,"A linear regression model expresses the relationship between one dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a linear equation of the form \(Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + \dots + \beta_nX_n + \epsilon\). The coefficients (\(\beta_1, \beta_2, \dots, \beta_n\)) quantify the effect of each independent variable on the dependent variable, and the intercept (\(\beta_0\)) represents the expected value of \(Y\) when all independent variables are zero. This makes interpretation straightforward: each coefficient estimates the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the corresponding independent variable, holding all other variables constant.","Linear regression is a model that involves a linear combination of input variables. A simple linear regression model relates a dependent variable to an independent variable. In the context of the office rentals dataset, a scatter plot of SIZE and RENTAL PRICE features with a linear model overlay shows that for every increase in SIZE, RENTAL PRICE increases. This model has limitations, but it is useful for prediction. Weights in the model indicate the effect of each descriptive feature on predictions. For the office rentals model, weights show that higher building floors lead to decreasing rental prices, and rental prices increase with broadband rates."
2,Linear Regression, What are the basic assumptions of the Linear Regression Algorithm?,"The basic assumptions of the Linear regression algorithm are as follows:

Linearity: The relationship between the features and target.
Homoscedasticity: The error term has a constant variance.
Multicollinearity: There is no multicollinearity between the features.
Independence: Observations are independent of each other.
Normality: The error(residuals) follows a normal distribution.","The basic assumptions of the Linear Regression Algorithm are:

1. Linearity: The relationship between the independent and dependent variables is linear.
2. Independence: The residuals (errors) are independent of each other.
3. Homoscedasticity: The variance of the residuals is constant across all levels of the independent variables.","Linear Regression primarily assumes that there is a linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. Other basic assumptions include homoscedasticity (constant variance of the errors), independence of errors, and normality of the error distribution. Additionally, it assumes no multicollinearity among the independent variables.","Linear regression models are a crucial starting point for understanding many nonlinear techniques, as many are generalizations of linear methods. Linear models assume the regression function E(Y |X) is linear or can be approximated linearly and is often embodied in a parametric model with a fixed number of parameters. The two widely used models are linear regression and least squares, which assumes f(x) is well approximated by a globally linear function. Least squares and linear regressions are powerful prediction methods that make different assumptions about structure. Linear regression is a parametric model that assumes the relationship between features and target is linear, making it less flexible. In contrast, linear regression can model complex relationships, but it provides stable predictions under certain conditions."
3,Linear Regression,What are the assumptions about the form of the model?,"It is assumed that there exists a linear relationship between the dependent and the independent variables. Sometimes, this assumption is known as the ‘linearity assumption’.","The assumptions about the form of the model in machine learning refer to the structure and relationships assumed within the data. This includes assumptions about linearity, independence of features, and noise in the data. Violation of these assumptions can affect the performance and interpretability of the model.","The assumptions about the form of the model typically refer to the underlying structure and relationships the model presumes between the input features and the target output. This includes assumptions about linearity, interactions, independence, distribution of errors, and the functional form like polynomial, exponential, etc., depending on the type of model being used (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression, or neural networks).","Parametric models often make strong assumptions about the data, such as linear regression assuming a linear relationship between features and target. The assumptions of linear models can be limiting, but they are also relatively simple to analyze. To address these limitations, models can be extended by considering linear combinations of fixed non-linear functions of the input variables. Statistical decision theory provides a framework for developing models, where the goal is to find a parsimonious model that accurately predicts the outcome."
4,Linear Regression,What are the Assumptions about the residuals?,"Normality assumption: The error terms, ε(i), are normally distributed.
Zero mean assumption: The residuals have a mean value of zero.
Constant variance assumption: The residual terms have the same (but unknown) value of variance, σ2. This assumption is also called the assumption of homogeneity or homoscedasticity.
Independent error assumption: The residual terms are independent of each other, i.e. their pair-wise covariance value is zero.
","The assumptions about the residuals in linear regression are that they should be normally distributed, have constant variance (homoscedasticity), and be independent of each other. Violations of these assumptions can lead to unreliable model predictions and inferences.","The assumptions about the residuals in a regression model typically include that they are normally distributed, have constant variance (homoscedasticity), and are independent of each other. These assumptions ensure that the statistical inference based on the regression results, such as confidence intervals and hypothesis tests, are valid.","Residual connections add the input to each function back onto its output, forming a residual block. A residual network (ResNet) consists of function outputs that learn the residual transformation. This allows for the training of deep networks with hundreds of layers and helps to reduce the vanishing gradients issue. The inclusion of residual connections also creates a smoother error function."
5,Linear Regression,What are the assumptions about the estimators?,"The independent variables are measured without error.
There does not exist a linear dependency between the independent variables, i.e. there is no multicollinearity in the data.","Estimators in machine learning are assumed to be unbiased and consistent, meaning that they should converge to the true parameter value as the amount of data increases. Additionally, estimators are assumed to have finite variance for valid inference.","Assumptions about estimators typically include that they are unbiased (the expected value of the estimator equals the true parameter value), consistent (the estimator converges to the true parameter value as the sample size increases), and efficient (the estimator has the smallest possible variance among all unbiased estimators). These properties ensure reliability and accuracy in statistical estimation.","Estimators, such as the sample variance, can have desirable properties including being unbiased and having small variance. However, being unbiased is not enough as the variance of an estimator is also important. Some properties of estimators include being consistent, having the smallest mean squared error of all linear estimators with no bias, and having the smallest asymptotic variance of any unbiased estimator. Biased estimators may be more desirable as they can trade a little bias for a larger reduction in variance. In some cases, linear regression or least squares estimates may have the smallest variance among all linear unbiased estimates."
6,Linear Regression,Explain the difference between Correlation and Regression.,"Correlation: It measures the strength or degree of relationship between two variables. It doesn’t capture causality. It is visualized by a single point.
Regression: It measures how one variable affects another variable. Regression is all about model fitting. It tries to capture the causality and describes the cause and the effect. It is visualized by a regression line.","Correlation measures the strength and direction of a relationship between two variables, while regression predicts the value of a dependent variable based on the value of one or more independent variables by fitting a line (or curve) to the data. Correlation does not imply causation, whereas regression can be used to infer causal relationships.","Correlation quantifies the degree to which two variables are related, indicating strength and direction of a relationship, but does not imply causation. Regression, on the other hand, is used to fit a model between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables, predicting the dependent variable based on the independents and implying a directional relationship where changes in predictors lead to changes in the response variable.","Key aspects of correlation, regression, and multivariable models are discussed. Correlation measures the linear relationship between variables and is represented by a correlation coefficient. A correlation matrix can exhibit relationships between multiple features. However, correlation does not account for non-linear relationships or the slope of a regression line. Multivariate Gaussian and Anscombe's quartet illustrate these limitations. In logistic regression and linear regression, assessing relationships between independent variables (e.g., total_bill and size) is crucial. A simple linear regression model relates a dependent variable to a linear combination of input variables. Covariance measures the relationship between variables, while the correlation coefficient reflects the noisiness and direction of a linear relationship. Strong correlations between independent variables can limit a model's unique information. Multivariable regression models involve an expansion of independent variables, which must be balanced to avoid cancellation or multicollinearity."
7,Linear Regression,Explain the Gradient Descent algorithm with respect to linear regression.,"Gradient descent is a first-order optimization algorithm. In linear regression, this algorithm is used to optimize the cost function to find the values of the βs (estimators) corresponding to the optimized value of the cost function.
","Gradient Descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function in Linear Regression. It works by updating model parameters in the direction of steepest descent of the cost function gradient, aiming to reach the optimal values for the coefficients, leading to a best-fitting linear model.","Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used in linear regression to minimize the cost function, which is typically the mean squared error between the predicted and actual values. It iteratively adjusts the parameters (coefficients) of the model by computing the gradient (derivative) of the cost function and moving in the direction that reduces the cost, with the step size determined by a learning rate.","The Gradient Descent algorithm uses differentiation to compute the slope of the error surface in optimizing parameters for regression problems. It is an iterative process that starts with initial values and moves in the opposite direction of the gradient, decreasing the value of the function. The learning rate determines the size of adjustments made to weights at each iteration. The update step involves adding a small delta value to the current weight to move downward on the error surface. The algorithm is called gradient descent or steepest descent, as it moves in the direction of the greatest rate of decrease of the error function. Multivariate linear regression can be solved using gradient descent, which will reach the minimum of the loss function. The update equation for each weight involves moving in the opposite direction of the gradient."
8,Linear Regression,Justify the cases where the linear regression algorithm is suitable for a given dataset.,"Generally, a Scatter plot is used to see if linear regression is suitable for any given data. So, we can go for a linear model if the relationship looks somewhat linear. Plotting the scatter plots is easy in the case of simple or univariate linear regression.But if we have more than one independent variable i.e, the case of multivariate linear regression, then two-dimensional pairwise scatter plots, rotating plots, and dynamic graphs can be plotted to find the suitableness.

On the contrary, to make the relationship linear we have to apply some transformations.
",Linear regression is suitable for datasets where there is a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables. It works well when the data points are spread out evenly around a straight line and there are no significant outliers present in the dataset.,"Linear regression is suitable for a given dataset when the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is linear, i.e., changes in the independent variables are consistently associated with changes in the dependent variable. It is also ideal when the dataset is free from extreme outliers and multicollinearity among predictor variables.","Linear models are essential for understanding nonlinear techniques in machine learning, as many nonlinear methods are direct generalizations of linear methods. The linear model assumes a linear or approximate linear regression function E(Y |X). Multiple linear regression is more applicable to machine learning, using more than one independent variable. The model can be simple but has significant shortcomings due to its linear assumption. Techniques like subset selection and gradient descent can improve prediction accuracy."
9,Linear Regression, List down some of the metrics used to evaluate a Regression Model.,"Mainly, there are five metrics that are commonly used to evaluate the regression models:

Mean Absolute Error(MAE)
Mean Squared Error(MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error(RMSE)
R-Squared(Coefficient of Determination)
Adjusted R-Squared","Some common metrics used to evaluate a Regression Model are Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R-squared (Coefficient of Determination), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).","Some common metrics used to evaluate a regression model include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (Coefficient of Determination). These metrics assess the difference between the predicted values and the actual values, helping to understand the accuracy of the model.","Evaluating model performance in machine learning involves using formal metrics and tools, particularly for regression and classification models. For classification models, the ROC curve and AUC are commonly used metrics. The test set is used to evaluate model performance, and the process can be repeated for k iterations to calculate the average performance. Model performance is determined by metrics that can be learned from data, and different metrics can work better for different datasets. Generalized additive models can be used to identify nonlinear regression effects. Evaluation measures include confusion matrix, misclassification rate, and average class accuracy."
10,Linear Regression,"For a linear regression model, how do we interpret a Q-Q plot?","The Q-Q plot represents a graphical plotting of the quantiles of two distributions with respect to each other. In simple words, we plot quantiles against quantiles in the Q-Q plot which is used to check the normality of errors.Whenever we interpret a Q-Q plot, we should concentrate on the ‘y = x’ line, which corresponds to a normal distribution. Sometimes, this line is also known as the 45-degree line in statistics.

It implies that each of the distributions has the same quantiles. In case you witness a deviation from this line, one of the distributions could be skewed when compared to the other i.e, normal distribution.","A Q-Q plot (quantile-quantile plot) is used to assess if the residuals from a linear regression model follow a normal distribution. If the residuals fall along a straight line on the Q-Q plot, it suggests that the residuals are normally distributed, supporting the assumption of the linear regression model.","A Q-Q (quantile-quantile) plot in the context of a linear regression model is used to check the normality of the residuals. If the points in the Q-Q plot lie approximately along a straight line, it indicates that the residuals are normally distributed; deviations from this line suggest deviations from normality.","A variety of regression and modeling concepts are discussed, including simple linear regression, multiclass classification, and regularized nonlinear modeling. The types of modeling are illustrated with plots and examples, including scatter plots, residual plots, and boxplots. The importance of balancing prediction error between training and test data is highlighted to avoid underfitting or overfitting. Various models and methods are compared, including linear regression, local linear regression smoothing, and Gaussian predictive distributions. The models are applied to real-world datasets and used for flexible classifying and screening for nonlinearities."
11,Linear Regression," In linear regression, what is the value of the sum of the residuals for a given dataset? Explain with proper justification.","The sum of the residuals in a linear regression model is 0 since it assumes that the errors (residuals) are normally distributed with an expected value or mean equal to 0, i.e.Y = βT X + ε
Here, Y is the dependent variable or the target column, and β is the vector of the estimates of the regression coefficient,

X is the feature matrix containing all the features as the columns, ε is the residual term such that ε ~ N(0, σ2).

Moreover, the sum of all the residuals is calculated as the expected value of the residuals times the total number of observations in our dataset. Since the expectation of residuals is 0, therefore the sum of all the residual terms is zero.","In linear regression, the sum of the residuals for a given dataset is always zero. This is because the residuals are the differences between the observed and predicted values, and the regression model is typically designed to minimize these differences during the fitting process.","In linear regression, the sum of the residuals (the differences between observed values and the values predicted by the model) is always zero, provided that the model includes a constant term (intercept). This occurs because the method of ordinary least squares, used to fit the regression model, determines the coefficients such that the mean of the residuals is zero, effectively balancing the overestimations and underestimations to sum to zero.","Residual connections in neural networks enable the training of deep networks with hundreds of layers, reducing the problem of vanishing gradients. In simple linear regression, the goal is to estimate E[Y |x] using a linear function, and the model can be fitted using the least squares method. Multiple linear regression involves making predictions using multiple input features. Regression trees can be used for classification and regression problems, and the residual sum of squares can be used to evaluate the fit of the model. Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) can be used to choose the parameters of a linear regression model, and the likelihood function is closely related to the error function used to evaluate the model's performance."
12,Linear Regression,What are RMSE and MSE? How to calculate it?,"RMSE and MSE are the two of the most common measures of accuracy for linear regression.

MSE (Mean Squared Error) is defined as the average of all the squared errors(residuals) for all data points. In simple words, we can say it is an average of squared differences between predicted and actual values.

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) is the square root of the average of squared differences between predicted and actual values.","RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and MSE (Mean Squared Error) are popular metrics used to evaluate the performance of regression models. MSE is calculated by squaring the difference between actual and predicted values, taking the average. RMSE is the square root of MSE, providing a measure of the model's prediction accuracy in the original units of the target variable.","RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and MSE (Mean Squared Error) are metrics used to measure the accuracy of prediction models by calculating the average squared difference between predicted and actual values. MSE is calculated by taking the mean of these squared differences, and RMSE is the square root of MSE, helping to scale the error back to the original units of the output variable. Formulaically, MSE = (1/n) * Σ(actual - predicted)² and RMSE = √MSE.","Training a Linear Regression model involves setting its parameters to best fit the training set. To evaluate the model, measures such as Mean Square Error (MSE) or Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) are used, with RMSE preferred for regression tasks. RMSE is more sensitive to outliers than Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The goal is to minimize the MSE or RMSE to optimize the model. Models with lower MSE or RMSE values perform better. Checking assumptions and verifying the model's performance on training and test data is crucial to detect issues and avoid overfitting."
13,Linear Regression,What is OLS?,"OLS stands for Ordinary Least Squares. The main objective of the linear regression algorithm is to find coefficients or estimates by minimizing the error term i.e, the sum of squared errors. This process is known as OLS.This method finds the best fit line, known as regression line by minimizing the sum of square differences between the observed and predicted values.","OLS stands for Ordinary Least Squares, which is a method used in linear regression to estimate the unknown parameters in a linear model by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the observed and predicted values.",Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is a type of linear regression analysis that estimates the parameters of a linear model by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the observed dependent variable and those predicted by the linear model. This method aims to find the best-fitting line through the data points by minimizing the least squares error.,"W stretching data results in neighborhoods that orthogonally stretch to decision boundaries. Support vector regression uses an ǫ-insensitive error measure, ignoring small errors. Ordinary least squares solution is used to solve a linear system of equations. BIO notation is used to represent named entities. Occam's razor is the principle of keeping theories as simple as possible. Elastic net regularization combines L1 and L2 penalties, resulting in a grouping effect for highly correlated variables."
14,Linear Regression,What are MAE and MAPE?,"MAE stands for Mean Absolute Error, which is defined as the average of absolute or positive errors of all values. In simple words, we can say MAE is an average of absolute or positive differences between predicted values and the actual values.

MAPE stands for Mean Absolute Percent Error, which calculates the average absolute error in percentage terms. In simple words, It can be understood as the percentage average of absolute or positive errors.","MAE (Mean Absolute Error) measures the average magnitude of errors without considering their direction. MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) calculates the average error as a percentage of the actual values, providing a more interpretable measure of prediction accuracy.","MAE (Mean Absolute Error) is a metric used to measure the average magnitude of errors in predictions, without considering their direction, calculated as the average of the absolute differences between the predicted values and the actual values. MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) is a measure of prediction accuracy in a regression model, expressed as the percentage that represents the average absolute difference between the actual and predicted values relative to the actual values, thereby providing a view of the prediction error as a percentage.","The RMSE is more sensitive to outliers than the MAE due to its higher focus on large values and neglect of small ones. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) measures a model's accuracy by calculating the average error between predictions and correct outputs. A lower error rate for both training and test datasets indicates that the model has learned the underlying trends and patterns. After training, the model's accuracy is verified by comparing the error rates of training and test datasets. If the model fails to accurately predict values from the test data, issues with data randomization are checked."
15,Linear Regression,Why do we square the residuals instead of using modulus?,"1. In fact, the absolute error is often closer to what we want when making predictions from our model. But, if we want to penalize those predictions that are contributing to the maximum value of error.

2. Moreover in mathematical terms, the squared function is differentiable everywhere, while the absolute error is not differentiable at all the points in its domain(its derivative is undefined at 0). This makes the squared error more preferable to the techniques of mathematical optimization. To optimize the squared error, we can compute the derivative and set its expression equal to 0, and solve. But to optimize the absolute error, we require more complex techniques having more computations.

3. Actually, we use the Root Mean Squared Error instead of Mean squared error so that the unit of RMSE and the dependent variable are equal and results are interpretable.","Squaring the residuals in regression analysis serves two main purposes: it penalizes larger errors more heavily than smaller ones, making the model more sensitive to outliers, and it preserves the property of differentiability, which is essential for mathematical optimization techniques used in model fitting. Using modulus would not achieve these objectives effectively.","Squaring the residuals, as done in methods like least squares, helps in emphasizing larger errors more than smaller ones, thus making the model more sensitive to outliers. Additionally, squaring makes the function differentiable, facilitating the use of calculus to find the minimum error, unlike absolute values which can create non-differentiable points at zero.","Fitting a linear model with quadratic regularization on coefficients allows for the inclusion of radial computational shortcuts. The root mean squared error (RMSE) tends to overestimate error slightly due to its overemphasis on individual large errors. In linear regression, the goal is to find the setting of parameters that minimizes the sum of squared residuals, and this is achieved through the normal equation. Quadratic approximations and inference relationships lead to asymptotic likelihood theory, stating that the estimated coefficients are consistent if the model is correct. Regularization techniques, such as L1 and L2, are used to reduce the model's complexity and prevent overfitting."
16,Linear Regression,List down the techniques that are adopted to find the parameters of the linear regression line which best fits the model.,"There are mainly two methods used for linear regression:1. Ordinary Least Squares(Statistics domain):

To implement this in Scikit-learn we have to use the LinearRegression() class.

2. Gradient Descent(Calculus family):

To implement this in Scikit-learn we have to use the SGDRegressor() class.","The techniques commonly used to find the parameters of the linear regression line are Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Gradient Descent, and Stochastic Gradient Descent. These methods aim to minimize the error between the actual and predicted values to determine the best fitting line.","The primary techniques used to find the parameters (coefficients) of the linear regression line are the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method, which minimizes the sum of the squared differences between observed and predicted values, and Gradient Descent, which iteratively adjusts the parameters to minimize the regression loss function. Additionally, techniques like Ridge Regression or Lasso Regression can be used, especially when dealing with multicollinearity or to achieve feature selection through regularization.","Regression problems defined via criterion spline models are quadratic surfaces. The familiar tools for modeling and inference in linear models are also available for these models. Linear regression models and least squares assume that the regression function E(Y|X) is linear, or that the linear model is a reasonable approximation. Nonlinear techniques are direct generalizations of linear methods. Cubic smoothing splines, Gaussian kernel, and generalized linear models can be used for regression. Basis functions play a crucial role in linear classification models. The choice of model, method, and features is important for a particular problem, but there is no guaranteed way to pick the best method."
17,Linear Regression,Which evaluation metric should you prefer to use for a dataset having a lot of outliers in it?,"Mean Absolute Error(MAE) is preferred when we have too many outliers present in the dataset because MAE is robust to outliers whereas MSE and RMSE are very susceptible to outliers and these start penalizing the outliers by squaring the error terms, commonly known as residuals.","For datasets with a lot of outliers, it is recommended to use evaluation metrics that are robust to outliers, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Median Absolute Error. These metrics are less sensitive to outliers compared to metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).","For a dataset with a lot of outliers, evaluation metrics that are robust to outliers should be preferred, such as median absolute error (MAE) instead of mean squared error (MSE), or employing robust versions of model performance metrics like the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) computed on ranked predictions rather than raw scores.","Metrics for evaluating models can be arbitrary, and no single metric is perfect as performance varies depending on the dataset. Outliers in a dataset can be identified using two approaches: comparing gaps between median, minimum, maximum, 1st quartile, and 3rd quartile values, or using exponential or skewed distributions in histograms. Algorithms for outlier detection include isolation forest, local outlier factor, and elliptic envelope. Novelty detection differs from anomaly detection as it assumes the algorithm is trained on a clean dataset without outliers. Custom loss functions may be used to handle noisy datasets, and domain knowledge can help determine if extreme values are plausible."
18,Linear Regression, Explain the normal form equation of the linear regression.,"The normal equation for linear regression is :β=(XTX)-1XTY

This is also known as the closed-form solution for a linear regression model.

where,

Y=βTX is the equation that represents the model for the linear regression,

Y is the dependent variable or target column,

β is the vector of the estimates of the regression coefficient, which is arrived at using the normal equation,","The normal form equation of linear regression is given as: β = (X^T X)^(-1) X^T y, where β represents the coefficient vector, X is the feature matrix, and y is the target vector. This equation calculates the optimal values for the coefficients by minimizing the sum of squared errors between the predicted and actual values.","The normal form equation of linear regression, also known as the normal equation, is a mathematical formula used to find the optimal parameters (coefficients) for linear regression. It is given by \(\theta = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y\), where \(X\) is the matrix of input features, \(y\) is the vector of target values, and \(\theta\) represents the coefficients that minimize the cost function, specifically the sum of squared differences between observed and predicted values.","Linear regression estimates E[Y|x] using a linear function w0 + wT x, assuming a conditional Gaussian distribution of Y given X. The goal is to find the best fitted line that minimizes the sum of squared residuals. The model can be represented as a conditional probability density p(y|x, θ) = N(y|μ(x), σ2(x)). The parameters can be chosen using maximum likelihood, which is equivalent to minimizing the sum of squared errors. The normal equations for the least squares problem are obtained by setting the gradient of the loss function to zero. The mean squared error (MSE) is a common loss function used in linear regression, which measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values."
19,Linear Regression,When should it be preferred to the Gradient Descent method instead of the Normal Equation in Linear Regression Algorithm?,"To answer the given question, let’s first understand the difference between the Normal equation and Gradient descent method for linear regression:

Gradient descent:
Needs hyper-parameter tuning for alpha (learning parameter).
It is an iterative process.
Time complexity- O(kn2)
Preferred when n is extremely large.

Normal Equation:
No such need for any hyperparameter.
It is a non-iterative process.
Time complexity- O(n3) due to evaluation of XTX.
Becomes quite slow for large values of n.

where,

‘k’ represents the maximum number of iterations used for the gradient descent algorithm, and

‘n’ is the total number of observations present in the training dataset.

Clearly, if we have large training data, a normal equation is not preferred for use due to very high time complexity but for small values of ‘n’, the normal equation is faster than gradient descent.","Gradient Descent is preferred over the Normal Equation when there are a large number of features in the dataset, as the Normal Equation can become computationally expensive to calculate the inverse of a large matrix. Gradient Descent is also more suitable for online learning scenarios when new data is continuously fed into the model.","Gradient Descent should be preferred over the Normal Equation when dealing with a large number of features or when the feature matrix is too large to fit into memory. This is because the Normal Equation requires the inversion of the matrix, which is computationally expensive (O(n^3)) and can be impractical for large datasets. Gradient Descent, being an iterative method, is more scalable and can handle larger datasets more efficiently.","Gradient Descent is a general optimization algorithm for finding the optimal solution to a wide range of problems. It works by iteratively tweaking parameters to minimize a cost function. The algorithm uses differentiation to compute the slope of the error surface. Choosing the right learning rate is crucial, as too small can lead to slow convergence and too large can cause the method to fail and oscillate around the minimum. Gradient Descent can be used for optimizing the objective function in Linear Regression, L1 and L2 regularization, and is also frequently used with neural networks."
